Welcome to the Encryption Scavenger Hunt!

In order to complete the tasks you will need openssl and gpg (GnuPrivacy Guard)
These can be obtained using your package manage on linux or HomeBrew on Mac (http://brew.sh/)

Each level is a gzipped tar archive that has been encrypted using opensslâ€™s
aes-256-cbc with the password at the end of the previous level

In order to decrypt the next level1 file run the following command

"openssl aes-256-cbc -d -a -in level1*.aes -out $(basename level1* .aes)"

And then enter the password.
For the following levels use the same command but 
use the level number corresponding to that level

good luck!

The Password to the level one is ENCRYPTIONGAME
